        <p class="lead">How are you today? Good.</p>
        <p>This is a very, <em>very</em> bare-bones prototype of Stitchly, an app I'm working on to create charts for knitting and crochet. If you're here, then it means I've probably sent you the link to ask if you can play around with it and give me feedback. So thanks for spending your time to help me develop it! I'm interested in any feedback you have, no matter how small. If you find something frustrating, then I want to know about it. If you find yourself thinking, "gee, I really wish that it let me do..." then I want to know that, too. So please <a href="mailto:caryn.vainio@gmail.com">give me a shout!</a></p>
